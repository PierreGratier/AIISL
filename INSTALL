1) Create a virtual environment
I recommend you install all the modules in a virtual environment. Skip this
step if you know what you are doing. Here are the instructions for python 3.6

Create a virtual environment folder (.venv):
> python3 -m venv .venv

Activate it:
> source .venv/bin/activate

You can check you are indeed using the virtual environment python
> which python
should print something along the lines of:
"/Users/xxxx/yyy/AIISL/.venv/bin/python"

2) Install the required modules:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

3) Start a Jupyter notebook server
> jupyter notebook

4) Run the tutorial notebook AIISL.ipynb
